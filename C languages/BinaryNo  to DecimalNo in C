Binary is the simplest kind of number system that uses only two digits of 0 and 1 (i.e. value of base 2).
Whereas Decimal number is most familiar number system to the general public.
It is base 10 which has only 10 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
For eg Binary of 5 is 101 
 When user inputs binary no such as 101 output will be 5.
